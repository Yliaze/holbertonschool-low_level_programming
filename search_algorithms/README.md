![C - Search Algorithms](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-Search_Algorithms-blue.svg)

This project focuses on search algorithms in the C programming language. It explores different search algorithms, such as linear search and binary search, and aims to understand their concepts and applications.

## Usage

To use the sorting algorithms implemented in this project, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:    

-   `git clone https://github.com/your_username/search_algorithms.git` 
    
2.   Compile the files:
    
-   `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o search` 
    
3.  Run the program:

- `./search`

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to test different search algorithms.
